Basic Planets with Table View and Planet Information

This is a basic app, made simply for practice with protocols and delegates and passing information from classes into View Controllers.

The app displays a table view of the planets (in order from the sun) and once chosen, additional information about the planet is displayed.

The home screen will eventually have a favorites section for additional practice with saving information using NSUserDefaults.
