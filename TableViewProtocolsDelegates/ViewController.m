// Create an application that allows a user to view a "profile" for a planet. The profile includes information about the planet and allows the user
// to add it to a separate part of the program that is reserved for favorite planets.
// Data stored can include the name of the planet, its distance from Earth, and notes about the planet or a photo.
// User should be able to cancel creating a new planet. Once the user saves the planet, it shows up on the home screen.

// Application Name:    iPlanets

//    Parts of the project:
//    ---------------------
//  - Home Screen, which has a logo, the app name, and buttons arranged in a menu to navigate to the different screens along with a tab bar controller
//  - Planet Table View, with a list containing the planets that the user can view more information about
//  - Planet Screens, which are navigated to when the user selects one from the Planet Table View List (or from the favorites section)
//  - Favorite Planets Table View, where a list of the user's favorite planets are stored and can be selected to view more planet information
